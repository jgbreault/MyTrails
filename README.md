# Predicting the Difficulty and Enjoyment Rating of Backpacking Trails

Here, I build machine learning models to predict the difficulty and enjoyment rating of backpacking trails I am personally interested in hiking. The base dataset of ~3000 trails is an exhaustive list of all trails in USA National Parks, scraped from Alltrails.com. I include data from trails I've hiked myself as well. I add a feature to keep track of which trails are mine, helping fine-tune the model to my preferences. A historical weather API is used to get climate data for each trail.
